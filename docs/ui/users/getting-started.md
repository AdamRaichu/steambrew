# Themes

To select a theme for your Steam Client to use, select one from the dropdown in the "Themes" tab within settings. 

If you don't already have any themes, you'll need to install some. Head over to https://steambrew.app/themes and pick out some themes you like.

## Installing Themes

1. Open Steam with Millennium installed and navigate to https://steambrew.app/themes
1. Select a theme you wish to use, click `Install`, and wait for the process to complete. 
1. Navigate to Steam Settings -> Themes -> Client Theme and select your newly installed theme.


# Plugins 

As of 6/11/2024, plugins don't quite yet have proper support. The only supported plugin is the pre-installed plugin "Millennium". We hope to have proper support in the near future! Stick around for development, or contribute if you'r tech savvy!


# Updates

The updates panel is a simple updater for your installed themes. You can select which themes you want to update from the latest publish version.
